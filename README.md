# React Map Application

This is a React application that integrates a map component. The main functionality is provided through several components and hooks, including `MapComponent`, `useMap`, and `MapInitializer`.

Currently, this map displays all the capital cities in the world. When a user clicks on a specific capital city, a popup appears showing the city's name and its population.
